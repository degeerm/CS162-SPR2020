PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
-Implementation of a Linked List with limited functionality.
 Allows the user to push_back, push_front, insert, print info,
 sort, and check input for certain functions. 
-Works with inputs of signed integers ONLY. Does not work for
 any other data type.
-No extra credit option was done.
-All functions should work.
*********************************************************
INCLUDED FILES:
-Makefile
-driver.cpp
	*Main program runs through input from user to add
	 to a Linked_List, sorts that information, and
 	 continues to do this until user wants to stop.
	*Also included in the driver file is a demo of
	 functions I didn't use in the main program, which
	 is the insert() and the get_length(). It is 
	 commented out by default.
-Node.h
-Node.cpp
	*Interface and implementation files for the Node 
	 class. Simply stores a value and an address to
	 the next node.
-Linked_List.h
-Linked_List.cpp
	*Interface and implementation files for the
	 Linked List class. Stores the length of the
	 list and the head, which points to the next
	 node, etc. Has functions for sorting, adding
	 elements, handling memory, etc.
